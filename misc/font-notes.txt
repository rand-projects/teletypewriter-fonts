Font notes to me when converting from SVG font to fontforge.
------------------------------------------------------------
Encoding -> Reencode -> ISO 8859-1 (Latin1)
Clear character 0
Pull up metrics window
     Make a line with a space and adjust ' ' metric
With all characters selected
     Element -> Transform -> Move y -200
Select all characters
       Right click set width and adjust width
       Then center all characters in width
       To Int
       Autohint
       Correct direction
Element -> Overlap -> Remove overlap
Element -> Add extrema
Element -> Font Info

To add emphasis:
----------------
Select all Elements
Element -> Style -> Change Weight
	Embolden by 10-12 (or what works)
Note: All the widths change! Set widths to constant.
Redo all the autohint remove overlap, etc

Converting to TTYts101-base.svg:
--------------------------------
Reencode
For all glyphs:
 Scale Uniformly 130%
 Move y -82
Then do all the usual..correct direction, extrema, overlap, set width, center
 in width, etc.
 
When changing weight for this font, 40 is a good value to try. You will
need to change kerning distance, recenter, etc.
