Reminder to me on how to make images of fonts. Once you run this
(with the correct filename), you have 10 seconds to select the fontforge
screen.

In one terminal:
   fontforge TTY28RE

   Maximize the font display.

In another terminal:

gnome-screenshot -d 10 -w -f TTY28RE.png

   Go back and select the fontforge window. In 10 seconds the screen shot
   will be taken.
