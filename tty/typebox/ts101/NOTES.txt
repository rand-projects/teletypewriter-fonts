Fontforge doesn't always do a great job with increasing the
weight of a font.

To increase wt. CJK 40em, no cleanup self intercept, maintain counters

After that, find intersections, simplify, etc.
For these fonts, 630 kern for the Book font.
Don't forget to center glyph (something you don't do for dot-matrix fonts).
