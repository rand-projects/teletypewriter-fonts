There is a directory for each original typebox. Typeboxes are named
by the letters stamped on the outside. The pallets in the typebox
do not always agree with what is supposed to be there. So 'RD-001'
means the first ('-001') typebox marked 'RD'.

Suffix of -NS means 'non-standard'. It is very common for people to
move pallets from typebox to typebox.

Photos are names with the format: number_character-name_copy.<image type>

'number' is the Teletype pallet number, character is the 1 character name
(or nothing if it won't work in a file name or isn't a standard character.
'character-name' is a more descriptive name if the single character
could not be used. 'copy' is usually left off, but if the typebox has more
that one of the same character, the first is '1', second is '2', etc.
